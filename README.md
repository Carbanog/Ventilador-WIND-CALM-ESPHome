# üåÄ WIND CALM Ceiling Fan ‚Äì ESPHome Integration

This project contains the complete ESPHome configuration to control the **WIND CALM** ceiling fan from the brand **CREATE**, which uses UART communication with a Tuya chip. It is fully compatible with Home Assistant.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Turn the fan on and off  
- Control 6 speed levels (values from 1 to 6 ‚Üí 1 % to 100 %)  
- Change the fan rotation direction  
- Turn the integrated light on and off  
- Select light color temperature (3 levels: 0, 500, 1000)  
- Mute the fan beeps  
- Monitor Wi-Fi signal strength and ESP uptime  
- Remotely restart the ESP32 from Home Assistant

## üß∞ Requirements

- An **ESP32 C3 SuperMini** with an external antenna (recommended for better Wi-Fi range in installations with a metal housing or interference).  
- WIND CALM ceiling fan with Tuya-based UART control

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Recommendations

- This project was tested with an **ESP32 C3 SuperMini** with an external antenna due to Wi-Fi signal issues caused by the fan's metal housing and the motor's electromagnetic noise. Models without an external antenna showed unstable connections, especially when the fan was running.  
- The fan's light is **white only**, not RGB. Color temperature selection works correctly via datapoint `23` (levels: 0, 500, 1000).  
- **Speeds** range from 1 to 6 (1 % ‚Üí 100 %), and must be integer values.  
- To use UART, you must **remove the original Tuya module (CB3S)**.  
- Some ESP32 models require **crossing TX and RX pins**.  
- Make sure you have **good Wi-Fi coverage**. The fan's metal housing reduces signal strength, and when the motor is running, the signal may drop even further.  
- The **beep** is automatically disabled on startup.

## üîß Additional Tips

- If the fan does not respond when changing speed, check the UART connections and Wi-Fi signal.  
- **Avoid using the timer (datapoint 64)**: once it expires, the fan turns off and stops responding to UART commands until turned on manually with the RF remote.  
- If you have coverage issues, consider using an **ESP32 with an external antenna** or moving your router closer to the fan.
